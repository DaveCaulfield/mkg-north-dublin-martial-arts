                <strong>Our story</strong> . . we have operated martial arts club in Skerries community centre for over 15 years. In 2019 we joined with the international MKG Martial Arts organisation which was set up by Guro Rick Faye in 1982. Our club is the first Irish club to join the MKG family.
                The MKG name comes from Guro Rick Fayes original startup, the "Minnesota Kali Group", which has grown over the last thirty years into a global martial arts organisation with clubs located across North America, Europe, UK and now Ireland.
