            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
                We have operated a martial arts club in Skerries, North Dublin for over 15 years. In 2019 we joined with
                the international MKG Martial Arts organisation which was set up by Guro Rick Faye (USA) in 1982. Our
                club is the first Irish club to join the MKG family.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MKG name comes from Guro Rick Fayes original startup the "Minnesota Kali Group" which has grown over
                the last thirty years into a global martial arts organisation with clubs located across USA, Europe, UK
                and now Ireland.
            </p>

            <p>The three main style of arts we teach . . .</p>

            <h2> Jeet Kune Do </h2>
            <p>
                JKD "Way of the Intercepting Fist" A principled based martial arts method developed by the late Bruce
                Lee which is primarily an empty hand approach to self protection. It focuses is on stopping an attack
                before the conflict even starts or as it's founder put it " the Art of fighting without fighting".
            </p>

            <h2>Kali</h2>
            <p> 
                A Filipino Martial Art meaning Body/Hand Movement, also called Escrima or Arnis. This is the indigenous
                art of the Philippines and is most notable for it use of various weapons such as single and double
                sticks, staff, swords, knives as well as a complete empty hand system referred to as Panatukan or "Dirty
                Boxing". Kali is not only an effective martial art but it's benefits also include improved cognitive
                ability.
            </p>

            <h2>MKG Kickboxing </h2>
            <p>
                This is a blended approach to striking used in all our programs that takes influence from many sources
                including JKD, Kali and Muay Thai. It improves physical and mental fitness as well as teaching students
                a foundation of body mechanics and an awarenes of their potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also host seminars bringing high level instructors from the UK, Europe & USA to share their expetise.
