                <strong>Our story</strong> . . we have operated martial arts club in Skerries community centre for over 15 years. In 2019 we joined with the international MKG Martial Arts organisation which was set up by Guro Rick Faye in 1982. Our club is the first Irish club to join the MKG family.
                The MKG name comes from Guro Rick Fayes original startup, the "Minnesota Kali Group", which has grown over the last thirty years into a global martial arts organisation with clubs located across North America, Europe, UK and now Ireland.

                              meaning Body/Hand Movement, also called Escrima or Arnis. This is the indigenous art of the Philippines and is most notable for it use of various weapons such as single and double sticks, staff, swords, knives as well as a complete empty hand system referred to as Panatukan or "Dirty Boxing". Kali is not only an effective martial art but it's benefits also include improved cognitive ability, discipline and it also looks cool.

                <strong> Jeet Kune Do (JKD) </strong>
                      <br>
                         "Way of the Intercepting Fist" A principled based martial arts method developed by the late Bruce Lee which is primarily an empty hand approach to self protection but at the highest level focus on stopping and attack as before the conflict even starts or as it's founder put it " the Art of fighting without fighting"
